# Production Use Considerations

While Caflax is primarily designed for development environments, it can be used in certain production scenarios with appropriate considerations.

## Suitable Production Scenarios

Caflax can be used effectively in the following production environments:

- **Small Internal Websites** - For internal tools and websites with limited traffic
- **Medium Traffic Static Sites** - For serving static content websites with moderate traffic
- **CDN Origin Servers** - As origin servers behind a CDN for static resource distribution
- **Internal Documentation Hosting** - For company knowledge bases and documentation portals

## Production Recommendations

If you decide to use Caflax in production, consider the following recommendations:

### 1. Use a Reverse Proxy

It's highly recommended to place Caflax behind a reverse proxy like Nginx, Caddy, or Apache for production deployments:

- **SSL/TLS Support** - Caflax doesn't include built-in HTTPS support, so use a reverse proxy to handle SSL/TLS termination
- **Additional Security** - Leverage the security features of mature reverse proxies
- **Load Balancing** - Distribute traffic across multiple Caflax instances for improved reliability

Example Nginx configuration as a reverse proxy for Caflax:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your-domain.com;
    
    # Redirect to HTTPS
    return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
}

server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name your-domain.com;

    # SSL configuration
    ssl_certificate /path/to/cert.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /path/to/key.pem;
    
    # Other SSL best practices...
    
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```

### 2. High-Traffic Considerations

For high-traffic websites:

- Consider professional static file hosting services (AWS S3, Netlify, Vercel, etc.)
- If using Caflax, implement a CDN in front to reduce origin server load
- Deploy multiple instances behind a load balancer for redundancy

### 3. Security Measures

When handling sensitive data:

- Add authentication and authorization layers (through the reverse proxy or additional services)
- Regularly update Caflax and its dependencies
- Run Caflax with minimal permissions
- Restrict network access as appropriate for your environment

### 4. Monitoring and Logging

Implement proper monitoring:

- Set up application monitoring for Caflax (resource usage, response times)
- Configure centralized logging to track access and errors
- Set up alerts for any anomalies or issues

### 5. Docker Deployment

For reliable and portable operation, consider deploying Caflax using Docker:

**Example Dockerfile:**

```dockerfile
FROM golang:1.18-alpine AS builder

WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN go build -o caflax

FROM alpine:latest

RUN apk --no-cache add ca-certificates
WORKDIR /root/
COPY --from=builder /app/caflax .

# Copy your static content
COPY ./public ./public

EXPOSE 3000

# Run with your preferred options
ENTRYPOINT ["./caflax", "-p", "3000", "-H", "0.0.0.0", "-d", "./public"]
```

**Example docker-compose.yml file:**

```yaml
version: '3'

services:
  caflax:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    volumes:
      - ./content:/root/public
    restart: unless-stopped
    # Add any environment variables if needed
```

Run with Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This approach offers several advantages:
- Consistent environment across deployments
- Easy scaling and management
- Simplified updates and rollbacks
- Isolation from the host system

## Limitations in Production

Be aware of these limitations when using Caflax in production:

- No built-in HTTPS support
- Limited authentication capabilities
- No built-in rate limiting
- No advanced caching mechanisms beyond basic HTTP caching
- No built-in monitoring or health check endpoints

For applications with stricter requirements in these areas, consider using more feature-rich alternatives or implementing these capabilities through your infrastructure stack.
